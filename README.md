# BlacklistEmojisBBDD
BetterDiscord plugin that lets you hide emotes you don't want. Please do read the description in the script:

"Hides emotes. Ctrl+Shift+X+LeftClick on the emote you want to hide. To unhide, good luck lmao (open the console with Ctrl+Shift+I, select the emote you want to delist and look for data-id's value. Then open C:\Users\*yourname*\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\plugins\BlacklistEmojis.config.json and  look for that ID and remove the line)."
