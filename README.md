# BlacklistEmojisBD
BetterDiscord plugin that lets you hide emotes you don't want. Please do read the description in the script:

" Ctrl+Shift+X+LeftClick on the emote you want to hide.
 Ctrl+Shift+Z+LeftClick to unhide. 
 For reactions, hovering over them while having the proper shortcut pressed will do the same. Idk why tho.
 To unhide manually, good luck lmao (open the console with Ctrl+Shift+I, select the emote you want to delist and look for data-id's value. Then open C:\Users\*yourname*\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\plugins\BlacklistEmojis.config.json and  look for that ID and remove the line)."
